*****
In this book, with its beautiful and naturalistic illustrations, thre is, as the title indicates,
a real return to nature; the plants are represented as they are, and not in the
conventionalised aspect which had become traditional in the earlier herbals, through
successie copying by one artists from another, without reference to the plants
themselves.  

...

The illustrations of Brunfels' herbal are incomparably better than the text, which
is very poor, and largely borrowed from previous writers.  Brunfels' knowledge of botany
was chiefly derived from the study of certain Italian authors, Manardus and
others, who spent their time in trying to identify the plants they saw
growing around them with those described by Dioscorides.  This was by no means
unreasonable in their case, since it was the plants of the Mediterranean
region that Dioscorides had enumerated.  When, however, Brunfels attempted
to employ the same methods in his examination of the flora of the Strasburg
district, and the left bank of the Rhine, many difficulties and
discrepancies arose.  He had no understanding of the geographical
distribution of plants, and did not realise that different
regions have dissimilar floras.  It is curious that should have been so, when
we remember that Theophrastus, more than eighteen hundred years earlier, had
clearly pointed out that the provinces of Asia have each their own
characteristic plants, and that some, which occur in one region,
are absent from another. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and

*****
In spite of his professional activity, Fuchs found time to produce a botanical masterpiece, which
appeared in 1542 from the press of Isingrin of Basle, under the title 'De historia stirpium.' This
was a Latin herbal dealing with about four hundred native German, and one hudred foreign
plants, and was followed in the succeeding yera by a German edition, called the 'New Kreüterbuch.'
Of all the botanists of the Renaissance, Fuchs is perhaps the one who deserves most to be
held in honour.  He is notably superior to his two predecessors in matters calling
for scholarship, such as the critical study of the plant nomenclature of
classical authors.  His herbal rivals, or even surpasses, that of
brunfels in its illustrations, and that of Bock in its
German text.

...

The wood-cuts which illustrate Fuchs' herbal are of extraordinary
beauty.  Some of them gain a special interest as being the first
European figures of certain American plants, e.g. Indian Corn and
the Great Pumpkin.

...

Fuchs arranged his work alphabetically, making no attempt at a
natural grouping of the plants, and his herbal is therefore without
importance in the history of plant classification.  His influence on
methods of plant description was, however, considerable, as is shown
by the fact that Dodoens, in his "Cruydeboeck,' took Fuchs' herbal
as a model for the order of description for each
plant. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 59-64

*****
His interest in the medical aspect of botany led him to write a herbal, and, in
order to illustrate it, he obtained the use of the woodblocks which had been
employed in the octavo edition of Fuchs' work.  To these a number of new
engravings were added.  The book was published in Dutch in the year 1554 by
Vanderloe, under the title "Cruydeboeck."  The text is not a translation
of Fuchs, as is sometimes supposed, although Dodoens too Fuchs as his
model for the order of description of each plant.
The method of arrangement is his own, and he indicates localities and
times of flowering in the Low Countries, information which clearly could
not have been derived from the earlier writer. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 72

Mattioli's 'Commentari in sex libros Pedacii Dioscoridis,' his chef-d'oeuvre, the gradual production
nad improvement of which occupied his leisure hours throughout his life, was
first published in 1544.  It was translated into many languages and appeared
in countless editions.

...

The title does not do the book justice, for it contains, besides an
exposition of Dioscorides, a Natural History dealing with all
the plants known to Mattioli.  The early editions had small
illustrations only, but, later on, editions with large and
very beautiful figures were published, such as that which appeared
in Venice in 1565. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 81-83

The system of classification, upon which de l'Obel's reputation really rests, is set forth in this book.

of their leaves.  He is thus led to make a rough separation between the

Monocotyledons. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 79

*****
This experience convinced Colonna that the knowledge of the identity
of the plants described by the ancients was in a most unsatisfactory
condition, and he set himself to produce a work which should remedy
this state of things.  This book was published in 1592, under the
name of 'Phytobasanos,' which embodies a quaint conceit after the
fashion of the time.  The title is a compound Greek word meaning
"plant torture," and was apparently employed by Colonna to explain
that he had subjected the plants to ordeal by torture, in order
to wrest from them the secret of their identity.  But it must be
confessed that Colonna himself is by no means free from error,
as regards the names which he assigns to them.

The great feature of the 'Phytobasanos,' however, is the
excellence of the descriptions and figures.  The latter are
famous as being the first etchings on copper used to
illustrate a botanical work.  They were an advance on all
previous plant drawings, except the work of Gesner and
Camerarius, in giving, in many cases, detailed analyses
of the flowers and fruit as well as habit
drawings. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 88

https://books.google.com/books?id=M8hfAAAAcAAJ[+https://books.google.com/books?id=M8hfAAAAcAAJ+]

*****
The first original work de l'Ecluse produced was an
account of the plants which he had observed while on an
adventurous expedition to Spain and Portugal with two
pupils.  This was so successful botanically that he
brought back two hundred new species.

...

In 1583 appeared our author's second work, which did the same service
for the botany of Austria and Hungary as the previous volume had done
for the botany of Spain.  These two works, together with some additional
matter, were republished in 1601 as the 'Rariorum plantarum historia.'
In this book, the species belonging to the same genus are often
brought together, but, beyond this, there is little attempt at
systematic arrangement.

De l'Ecluse was weak in the synthetic facility, his
strength lying rather in his powers of observation.  Cuvier
reckons that he added more than six hundred to the number of
known plants.  It is characteristic of his versatile mind,
that his botanical interests were not confined, like those
of most of the early workers, to flowering plants.  A
manuscript is preserved in the Leyden Library containing
more than eighty beautiful water-colour drawings of fungi,
executed under the direction of l'Ecluse, by artists
employed by his great friend and patron, Baron Boldizsar
de Batthyany.  This gentleman is said to have been so
enthusiastic a botanist, that he set a Turkish prisoner
at liberty, on the condition that he should obtain plants
for him from Turkey. 

...

[De l'Ecluse] deserves especial gratitude for one benefit of
a very practical nature, namely the introduction of the Potato
into Germany and
Austria. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 77-78

*****
The 'Prodromos theatri botanici' of 1620 consisted of descriptions of 600 species, which the author
regarded as new, although several had, as a matter of fact, been already described
by de l'Ecluse.  Figures of about 140 species
are given. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 95

*****
Bauhin's 'Pinax' converted chaos into order, since it contained the first complete and
methodical concordance of the names of plants, and was so authoritative as
to earn for the author the title of "legislateur en botanique."
The work, which dealt with about 6000 plants, was recognised as pre-eminent for
many years.

...

As Sachs long ago pointed out, this work is "the first and for that time a completely
exhaustive book of synonyms, and is still indispensible for the
history of individual species--no small praise to be given to
a work that is more than 250 years old." - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 96

The importance of Gerard's 'Herball' in the history of botany is chiefly
due to an improved edition, brought out by Thomas Johnson in 1633, thirty-six
years after the work was originally published.  ...  He greatly enlarged
the 'Herball,' and illustrated it with Plantin's woodcuts.  His edition
contained an account of no less than 2850 plants.  John also corrected
numerous errors, and the whole work, transformed by him, rose to a much
higher grade of value.  - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 113

Jean Bauhin's chief botanical work, the 'Histoire universelle des plantes,' was a most
ambitious undertaking, which he did not live to see published.
However, his son-in-law Cherler, a physician of Basle, who had helped
him in preparing it, brought out a preliminary sketch of it in
1619, and, in 1650 and 1651, the magnus opus itself was
published, under the name of 'Historia plantarum universalis.'
This book is a compilation from all sources, and includes descriptions
of 5000 plants. The figures, of which there are more than 3500, are small and
badly executed.  A large proportion of them are ultimately
derived from those of Fuchs. - Arber, https://books.google.com/books?id=BmwZAAAAYAAJ[Herbals, Their Origin and Evolution], p. 93-94

=====
"From prehistoric times to the present, the ways in which man has made flour for his bread have forged the patterns of technological progress and have greatly influenced his social development. This book describes in detail how people of the western world have ground their grain - by hand, by animal-driven wheels, by crude water-powered mills, and, finally, by complex engineering methods. The story of milling provides a graphic history of man's ingenuity in the mechanical arts, his harnessing of power sources, and his development of agricultural skill.While the central theme is the improvement of technical processes, this development is presented, not in a vacuum, but in the context of economic geography and social history. Thus the volume offers much of importance to students of social economic history, archaeology, anthropology, sociology, agriculture, and general technology, as well as those with a specific interest in milling methods.The book brings to readers some of the advantages of what was originally projected as a museum of flour milling several years ago by General Mills. Walter Dorwin Teague, the noted industrial designer, drew plans for the museum and arranged for the fundamental research, which was carried out by Dr. John Storck, anthropologist and former professor at Columbia University and Sarah Lawrence College. Hundreds of detailed drawings illustrating the processes and devices described were prepared under their direction. Although plans for the museum had to be abandoned, the extensive research and excellent illustrative material are now made available in this comprehensive, single volume history of milling and its social and economic implications."
