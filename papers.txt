*How to simulate the Universe in a Computer* (paper, PDF, 2004, 8) - Alexander
Knebe -
http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412565[+http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0412565+]

*****
In this contribution a broad overview of the methodologies of cosmological
N-body simulations and a short introduction explaining the general idea behind
such simulations is presented. After explaining how to set up the initial
conditions using a set of N particles two (diverse) techniques are presented
for evolving these particles forward in time under the influence of their
self-gravity. One technique (tree codes) is solely based upon a sophistication
of the direct particle-particle summation whereas the other method relies on
the continuous (de-)construction of arbitrarily shaped grids and is realized
in adaptive mesh refinement codes.

*****
This article presents an overview of computability logic -- the
game-semantically constructed logic of interactive computational tasks and
resources. There is only one non-overview, technical section in it, devoted to
a proof of the soundness of affine logic with respect to the semantics of
computability logic.

Computation and computational problems in Computability Logic are understood
in their most general, interactive sense, and are precisely seen as games
played by a machine (computer, agent, robot) against its environment (user,
nature, or the devil himself). Computability of such problems means existence
of a machine that always wins the game. Logical operators stand for operations
on computational problems, and validity of a logical formula means being a
scheme of "always computable" problems.

*Evolutionary games on graphs* (paper, PDF, 2007, 133) - Gyorgy Szabo & Gabor
Fath -
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0607344[+http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0607344+]

*****
Game theory is one of the key paradigms behind many scientific disciplines
from biology to behavioral sciences to economics. In its evolutionary form and
especially when the interacting agents are linked in a specific social network
the underlying solution concepts and methods are very similar to those applied
in non-equilibrium statistical physics. This review gives a tutorial-type
overview of the field for physicists. The first three sections introduce the
necessary background in classical and evolutionary game theory from the basic
definitions to the most important results. The fourth section surveys the
topological complications implied by non-mean-field-type social network
structures in general. The last three sections discuss in detail the dynamic
behavior of three prominent classes of models: the Prisoner's Dilemma, the
Rock-Scissors-Paper game, and Competing Associations. The major theme of the
review is in what sense and how the graph structure of interactions can modify
and enrich the picture of long term behavioral patterns emerging in
evolutionary games.

*Stochastic Models of Evolution in Genetics, Ecology and Linguistics* (paper,

http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703478[+http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703478+]

*****
We give a overview of stochastic models of evolution that have found
applications in genetics, ecology and linguistics for an audience of
nonspecialists, especially statistical physicists. In particular, we focus
mostly on neutral models in which no intrinsic advantage is ascribed to a
particular type of the variable unit, for example a gene, appearing in the
theory. In many cases these models are exactly solvable and furthermore go
some way to describing observed features of genetic, ecological and linguistic
systems.

*****
The characterisation of ever smaller and fainter extrasolar planets requires
an intricate understanding of one's data and the analysis techniques used.
Correcting the raw data at the 10^-4 level of accuracy in flux is one of the
central challenges. This can be difficult for instruments that do not feature
a calibration plan for such high precision measurements. Here, it is not
always obvious how to de-correlate the data using auxiliary information of the
instrument and it becomes paramount to know how well one can disentangle
instrument systematics from one's data, given nothing but the data itself. We
propose a non-parametric machine learning algorithm, based on the concept of
independent component analysis, to de-convolve the systematic noise and all
non-Gaussian signals from the desired astrophysical signal. Such a `blind'
signal de-mixing is commonly known as the `Cocktail Party problem' in
signal-processing. Given multiple simultaneous observations of the same
exoplanetary eclipse, as in the case of spectrophotometry, we show that we can
often disentangle systematic noise from the original light curve signal
without the use of any complementary information of the instrument. In this
paper, we explore these signal extraction techniques using simulated data and
two data sets observed with the Hubble-NICMOS instrument. Another important
application is the de-correlation of the exoplanetary signal from
time-correlated stellar variability. Using data obtained by the Kepler mission
we show that the desired signal can be de-convolved from the stellar noise
using a single time series spanning several eclipse events. Such
non-parametric techniques can provide important confirmations of the existent
parametric corrections reported in the literature, and their associated
results. Additionally they can substantially improve the precision
exoplanetary light curve analysis in the future.

*One Decade of Universal Artificial Intelligence* (paper, PDF, 2012, 20) -
Marcus Hutter -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6153[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6153+]

*****
The first decade of this century has seen the nascency of the first
mathematical theory of general artificial intelligence. This theory of
Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) has made significant contributions to
many theoretical, philosophical, and practical AI questions. In a series of
papers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete
mathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and
rigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing
intelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the
philosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of
rational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric.
Recently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and
experimentally investigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical
breakthrough has resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting
earlier critique that UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without
providing any domain knowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a
diverse range of interactive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn
from scratch to play TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial
and error, without even providing the rules of the games.
These achievements give new hope that the grand goal of Artificial General
Intelligence is not elusive.
This article provides an informal overview of UAI in context. It attempts to
gently introduce a very theoretical, formal, and mathematical subject, and
discusses philosophical and technical ingredients, traits of intelligence,
some social questions, and the past and future of UAI.

*****
This paper introduces a principled approach for the design of a scalable
general reinforcement learning agent. Our approach is based on a direct
approximation of AIXI, a Bayesian optimality notion for general reinforcement
learning agents. Previously, it has been unclear whether the theory of AIXI
could motivate the design of practical algorithms. We answer this hitherto
open question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally
feasible approximation to the AIXI agent. To develop our approximation, we
introduce a new Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm along with an agent-specific
extension to the Context Tree Weighting algorithm. Empirically, we present a
set of encouraging results on a variety of stochastic and partially observable
domains. We conclude by proposing a number of directions for future research.

http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0404005[+http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0404005+]

*****
The subject of moving curves (and surfaces) in three dimensional space (3-D)
is a fascinating topic not only because it represents typical nonlinear
dynamical systems in classical mechanics, but also finds important
applications in a variety of physical problems in different disciplines.
Making use of the underlying geometry, one can very often relate the
associated evolution equations to many interesting nonlinear evolution
equations, including soliton possessing nonlinear dynamical systems. Typical
examples include dynamics of filament vortices in ordinary and superfluids,
spin systems, phases in classical optics, various systems encountered in
physics of soft matter, etc. Such interrelations between geometric evolution
and physical systems have yielded considerable insight into the underlying
dynamics. We present a succinct tutorial analysis of these developments in
this article, and indicate further directions. We also point out how evolution
equations for moving surfaces are often intimately related to soliton
equations in higher dimensions.

*Bluff your way in the second law of thermodynamics
Jos Uffink* (paper, PDF, 2001, 89) - Jos Uffink -
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0005327[+http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0005327+]

*****
The aim of this article is to analyze the relation between the second law of
thermodynamics and the so-called arrow of time. For this purpose, a number of
different aspects in this arrow of time are distinguished, in particular those
of time-(a)symmetry and of (ir)reversibility. Next I review versions of the
second law in the work of Carnot, Clausius, Kelvin, Planck, Gibbs,
Carath\'eodory and Lieb and Yngvason, and investigate their connection with
these aspects of the arrow of time.
It is shown that this connection varies a great deal along with these
formulations of the second law. According to the famous formulation by Planck,
the second law expresses the irreversibility of natural processes. But in many
other formulations irreversibility or even time-asymmetry plays no role.
I therefore argue for the view that the second law has nothing to do with the
arrow of time.

*****
The twenty-first century is starting with a huge bang. For the person in the
street, the bang is about a technical revolution that may eventually dwarf the
industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, having already produced
a drastic change in the rules of economics. For the scientifically minded, one
aspect of this bang is the complexity revolution, which is changing the focus
of research in all scientific disciplines, for instance human biology and
medicine. What role does physics, the oldest and simplest science, have to
play in this? Being a theoretical physicist to the core, I want to focus on
theoretical physics. Is it going to change also?

Twentieth-century theoretical physics came out of the relativistic revolution
and the quantum mechanical revolution. It was all about simplicity and
continuity (in spite of quantum jumps). Its principal tool was calculus. Its
final expression was field theory.

Twenty-first-century theoretical physics is coming out of the chaos
revolution. It will be about complexity and its principal tool will be the
computer. Its final expression remains to be found. Thermodynamics, as a vital
part of theoretical physics, will partake in the transformation.

*Toward a Theory of Chaos* (paper, PDF, 2004, 103) - A. Sengupta -
http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0408044[+http://arxiv.org/abs/nlin/0408044+]

*****
This paper formulates a new approach to the study of chaos in discrete
dynamical systems based on the notions of inverse ill-posed problems,
set-valued mappings, generalized and multivalued inverses, graphical
convergence of a net of functions in an extended multifunction space, and the
topological theory of convergence. Order, chaos, and complexity are described
as distinct components of this unified mathematical structure that can be
viewed as an application of the theory of convergence in topological spaces to
increasingly nonlinear mappings, with the boundary between order and
complexity in the topology of graphical convergence being the region in
Multi(X) that is susceptible to chaos. The paper uses results from the
discretized spectral approximation in neutron transport theory and concludes
that the numerically exact results obtained by this approximation of the Case
singular eigenfunction solution is due to the graphical convergence of the
Poisson and conjugate Poisson kernels to the Dirac delta and the principal
value multifunctions respectively. In Multi(X), the continuous spectrum is
shown to reduce to a point spectrum, and we introduce a notion of latent
chaotic states to interpret superposition over generalized eigenfunctions.
Along with these latent states, spectral theory of nonlinear operators is used
to conclude that nature supports complexity to attain efficiently a
multiplicity of states that otherwise would remain unavailable to it.

The aim of this book is to develop "from the ground up" many of the major,
exciting, pre- and post-millenium developments in the general area of study
known as quantum Shannon theory. As such, we spend a significant amount of
time on quantum mechanics for quantum information theory (Part II), we give a
careful study of the important unit protocols of teleportation, super-dense
coding, and entanglement distribution (Part III), and we develop many of the
tools necessary for understanding information transmission or compression
(Part IV). Parts V and VI are the culmination of this book, where all of the
tools developed come into play for understanding many of the important results
in quantum Shannon theory.

*Quantum computing and the entanglement frontier* (paper, PDF, 2012, 18) -
John Preskill -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5813[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5813+]

*****
Quantum information science explores the frontier of highly complex quantum
states, the "entanglement frontier." This study is motivated by the
observation (widely believed but unproven) that classical systems cannot
simulate highly entangled quantum systems efficiently, and we hope to hasten
the day when well controlled quantum systems can perform tasks surpassing what
can be done in the classical world. One way to achieve such "quantum
supremacy" would be to run an algorithm on a quantum computer which solves a
problem with a super-polynomial speedup relative to classical computers, but
there may be other ways that can be achieved sooner, such as simulating exotic
quantum states of strongly correlated matter. To operate a large scale quantum
computer reliably we will need to overcome the debilitating effects of
decoherence, which might be done using "standard" quantum hardware protected
by quantum error-correcting codes, or by exploiting the nonabelian quantum
statistics of anyons realized in solid state systems, or by combining both
methods. Only by challenging the entanglement frontier will we learn whether
Nature provides extravagant resources far beyond what the classical world
would allow.

The exponential increase of availability of digital data and the necessity to
process it in business and scientific fields has literally forced upon us the
need to analyze and mine useful knowledge from it. Traditionally data mining
has used a data warehousing model of gathering all data into a central site,
and then running an algorithm upon that data. Such a centralized approach is
fundamentally inappropriate due to many reasons like huge amount of data,
infeasibility to centralize data stored at multiple sites, bandwidth
limitation and privacy concerns. To solve these problems, Distributed Data
Mining (DDM) has emerged as a hot research area. Careful attention in the
usage of distributed resources of data, computing, communication, and human
factors in a near optimal fashion are paid by distributed data mining. DDM is
gaining attention in peer-to-peer (P2P) systems which are emerging as a choice

*****
The biological immune system is a robust, complex, adaptive system that
defends the body from foreign pathogens. It is able to categorize all cells
(or molecules) within the body as self-cells or non-self cells. It does this
with the help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take
action from a local and also a global perspective using its network of
chemical messengers for communication. There are two major branches of the
immune system. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that
detects and destroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune
system responds to previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to
them that can remain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable
information processing biological system has caught the attention of computer
science in recent years. A novel computational intelligence technique,
inspired by immunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several
concepts from the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real
world science and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe
the immune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune
Systems methods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable
for Artificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough
for one such problem. A comparison of the Artificial Immune Systems to other
well-known algorithms, areas for future work, tips & tricks and a list of
resources will round this tutorial off. It should be noted that as Artificial
Immune Systems is still a young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed
algorithm template and hence actual implementations might differ somewhat from
time to time and from those examples given here.

*****
Some basic mathematical tools such as convex sets, polytopes and combinatorial
topology, are used quite heavily in applied fields such as geometric modeling,
meshing, computer vision, medical imaging and robotics. This report may be
viewed as a tutorial and a set of notes on convex sets, polytopes, polyhedra,
combinatorial topology, Voronoi Diagrams and Delaunay Triangulations. It is
intended for a broad audience of mathematically inclined readers. I have
included a rather thorough treatment of the equivalence of V-polytopes and
H-polytopes and also of the equivalence of V-polyhedra and H-polyhedra, which
is a bit harder. In particular, the Fourier-Motzkin elimination method (a
version of Gaussian elimination for inequalities) is discussed in some detail.
I also included some material on projective spaces, projective maps and polar
duality w.r.t. a nondegenerate quadric in order to define a suitable notion of
``projective polyhedron'' based on cones. To the best of our knowledge, this
notion of projective polyhedron is new. We also believe that some of our
proofs establishing the equivalence of V-polyhedra and H-polyhedra are new.

*Normal and Anomalous Diffusion: A Tutorial* (paper, PDF, 2008, 39) -
http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0419[+http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.0419+]

*****
The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the main concepts behind normal
and anomalous diffusion. Starting from simple, but well known experiments, a
series of mathematical modeling tools are introduced, and the relation between
them is made clear. First, we show how Brownian motion can be understood in
terms of a simple random walk model. Normal diffusion is then treated (i)
through formalizing the random walk model and deriving a classical diffusion
equation, (ii) by using Fick's law that leads again to the same diffusion
equation, and (iii) by using a stochastic differential equation for the
particle dynamics (the Langevin equation), which allows to determine the mean
square displacement of particles. (iv) We discuss normal diffusion from the
point of view of probability theory, applying the Central Limit Theorem to the
random walk problem, and (v) we introduce the more general Fokker-Planck
equation for diffusion that includes also advection. We turn then to anomalous
diffusion, discussing first its formal characteristics, and proceeding to
Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) as a model for anomalous diffusion. It is
shown how CTRW can be treated formally, the importance of probability
distributions of the Levy type is explained, and we discuss the relation of
CTRW to fractional diffusion equations and show how the latter can be derived
from the CTRW equations. Last, we demonstrate how a general diffusion equation
can be derived for Hamiltonian systems, and we conclude this tutorial with a
few recent applications of the above theories in laboratory and astrophysical
plasmas.

*****
Shape Dynamics (SD) is a new theory of gravity that is based on fewer and more
fundamental first principles than General Relativity (GR). The most important
feature of SD is the replacement of GR's relativity of simultaneity with a
more tractable gauge symmetry, namely invariance under spatial conformal
transformations. This Tutorial contains both a quick introduction for readers
curious about SD and a detailed walk-through of the historical and conceptual
motivations for the theory, its logical development from first principles and
an in-depth description of its present status. The Tutorial is sufficiently
self-contained for an undergrad student with some basic background in General
Relativity and Lagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics. It is intended both as a
reference text for students approaching the subject, and as a review article
for researchers interested in the theory.

*****
These lectures deal with the problem of inductive inference, that is, the
problem of reasoning under conditions of incomplete information. Is there a
general method for handling uncertainty? Or, at least, are there rules that
could in principle be followed by an ideally rational mind when discussing
scientific matters? What makes one statement more plausible than another? How
much more plausible? And then, when new information is acquired how do we
change our minds? Or, to put it differently, are there rules for learning? Are
there rules for processing information that are objective and consistent? Are
they unique? And, come to think of it, what, after all, is information? It is
clear that data contains or conveys information, but what does this precisely
mean? Can information be conveyed in other ways? Is information physical? Can
we measure amounts of information? Do we need to? Our goal is to develop the
main tools for inductive inference--probability and entropy--from a thoroughly
Bayesian point of view and to illustrate their use in physics with examples
borrowed from the foundations of classical statistical physics.

*****
This review addresses a central question in the field of complex systems:
given a fluctuating (in time or space), sequentially measured set of
experimental data, how should one analyze the data, assess their underlying
trends, and discover the characteristics of the fluctuations that generate the
experimental traces? In recent years, significant progress has been made in
addressing this question for a class of stochastic processes that can be
modeled by Langevin equations, including additive as well as multiplicative
fluctuations or noise. Important results have emerged from the analysis of
temporal data for such diverse fields as neuroscience, cardiology, finance,
economy, surface science, turbulence, seismic time series and epileptic brain
dynamics, to name but a few. Furthermore, it has been recognized that a
similar approach can be applied to the data that depend on a length scale,
such as velocity increments in fully developed turbulent flow, or height
increments that characterize rough surfaces. A basic ingredient of the
approach to the analysis of fluctuating data is the presence of a Markovian
property, which can be detected in real systems above a certain time or length
scale. This scale is referred to as the Markov–Einstein (ME) scale, and has
turned out to be a useful characteristic of complex systems. We provide a
review of the operational methods that have been developed for analyzing
stochastic data in time and scale. We address in detail the following issues:
(i) reconstruction of stochastic evolution equations from data in terms of the
Langevin equations or the corresponding Fokker–Planck equations and (ii)
intermittency, cascades, and multiscale correlation functions.

Pi, uniquely in mathematics, is pervasive in popular culture and

For many scientific calculations, particularly those involving empirical data,
IEEE 32-bit floating-point arithmetic produces results of sufficient accuracy,
while for other
applications IEEE 64-bit floating-point is more appropriate. But for some very
demanding
applications, even higher levels of precision are often required. This article
discusses
the challenge of high-precision computation, in the context of mathematical
physics, and
highlights what facilities are required to support future computation, in

At the present time, IEEE 64-bit floating-point arithmetic is sufficiently

by high-precision software packages that include high-level language

minimize the conversion effort. This paper presents an overview of recent
applications of
these techniques and provides some analysis of their numerical requirements.

that high-precision arithmetic facilities are now an indispensable component

Stochastic computing (SC) was proposed in the 1960s as a low-cost alternative
to conventional binary computing.
It is unique in that it represents and processes information in the
form of digitized probabilities. SC
employs very low-complexity arithmetic units which was a primary design
concern in the past. Despite this
advantage and also its inherent error tolerance, SC was seen as impractical
because of very long
computation times and relatively low accuracy. However, current technology trends
tend to increase uncertainty
in circuit behavior and imply a need to better understand, and perhaps
exploit, probability in computation.
This article surveys SC from a modern perspective where the small size, error
resilience, and probabilistic
features of SC may compete successfully with conventional methodologies in
certain applications. First, we
survey the literature and review the key concepts of stochastic number
representation and circuit structure.
We then describe the design of SC-based circuits and evaluate their advantages
and disadvantages. Finally,
we give examples of the potential applications of SC and discuss some
practical problems that are yet to be
solved.

Physical approach to complex systems (paper, PDF, 2012, 112) - J. Kwapien & S. Drozdz -

*****
Typically, complex systems are natural or social systems which consist of a
large number of nonlinearly interacting elements. These systems are open, they
interchange information or mass with environment and constantly modify their
internal structure and patterns of activity in the process of
self-organization. As a result, they are flexible and easily adapt to variable
external conditions. However, the most striking property of such systems is
the existence of emergent phenomena which cannot be simply derived or
predicted solely from the knowledge of the systems’ structure and the
interactions among their individual elements. This property points to the
holistic approaches which require giving parallel descriptions of the same
system on different levels of its organization. There is strong
evidence–consolidated also in the present review–that different, even
apparently disparate complex systems can have astonishingly similar
characteristics both in their structure and in their behaviour. One can thus
expect the existence of some common, universal laws that govern their
properties.

Physics methodology proves helpful in addressing many of the related issues.
In this review, we advocate some of the computational methods which in our
opinion are especially fruitful in extracting information on selected–but at
the same time most representative–complex systems like human brain, financial
markets and natural language, from the time series representing the
observables associated with these systems. The properties we focus on comprise
the collective effects and their coexistence with noise, long-range
interactions, the interplay between determinism and flexibility in evolution,
scale invariance, criticality, multifractality and hierarchical structure. The
methods described either originate from “hard” physics–like the random matrix
theory–and then were transmitted to other fields of science via the field of
complex systems research, or they originated elsewhere but turned out to be
very useful also in physics — like, for example, fractal geometry. Further
methods discussed borrow from the formalism of complex networks, from the
theory of critical phenomena and from nonextensive statistical mechanics. Each
of these methods is helpful in analyses of specific aspects of complexity and
all of them are mutually complementary.

*****
The power-law scaling observed in the primary statistical analysis is an
important, but by far not the only feature characterizing experimental data.
The scaling function, the distribution of energy fluctuations, the
distribution of inter-event waiting times, and other higher order spatial and
temporal correlations, have seen increased consideration over the last years.
Leading to realization that basic models, like the original sandpile model,
are often insufficient to adequately describe the complexity of real-world
systems with power-law distribution.

Consequently, a substantial amount of effort has gone into developing new and
extended models and, hitherto, three classes of models have emerged. The first
line of models is based on a separation between the time scales of an external
drive and an internal dissipation, and includes the original sandpile model
and its extensions, like the dissipative earthquake model. Within this
approach the steady state is close to criticality in terms of an absorbing
phase transition. The second line of models is based on external drives and
internal dynamics competing on similar time scales and includes the coherent
noise model, which has a non-critical steady state characterized by
heavy-tailed distributions. The third line of models proposes a non-critical
self-organizing state, being guided by an optimization principle, such as the
concept of highly optimized tolerance.

Self-oscillation (paper, PDF, 2012, 55) - A. Jenkins -

*****
Physicists are very familiar with forced and parametric resonance, but usually
not with self-oscillation, a property of certain dynamical systems that gives
rise to a great variety of vibrations, both useful and destructive. In a
self-oscillator, the driving force is controlled by the oscillation itself so
that it acts in phase with the velocity, causing a negative damping that feeds
energy into the vibration: no external rate needs to be adjusted to the
resonant frequency. The famous collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge in 1940,
often attributed by introductory physics texts to forced resonance, was
actually a self-oscillation, as was the swaying of the London Millennium
Footbridge in 2000. Clocks are self-oscillators, as are bowed and wind musical
instruments. The heart is a “relaxation oscillator”, i.e., a non-sinusoidal
self-oscillator whose period is determined by sudden, nonlinear switching at
thresholds. We review the general criterion that determines whether a linear
system can self-oscillate. We then describe the limiting cycles of the
simplest nonlinear self-oscillators, as well as the ability of two or more
coupled self-oscillators to become spontaneously synchronized (“entrained”).
We characterize the operation of motors as self-oscillation and prove a
theorem about their limit efficiency, of which Carnot’s theorem for heat
engines appears as a special case. We briefly discuss how self-oscillation
applies to servomechanisms, Cepheid variable stars, lasers, and the
macroeconomic business cycle, among other applications. Our emphasis
throughout is on the energetics of self-oscillation, often neglected by the
literature on nonlinear dynamical systems.

Experimental econophysics is concerned with statistical physics of humans in

physicists to study some problems related to economics or finance. It relies
on controlled human experiments in the laboratory together with agent-based
modeling (for computer simulations and/or analytical theory), with an attempt
to reveal the general cause–effect relationship between specific conditions
and emergent properties of real economic/financial markets (a kind of complex
adaptive systems). Here I review the latest progress in the field, namely,
stylized facts, herd behavior, contrarian behavior, spontaneous cooperation,
partial information, and risk management. Also, I highlight the connections
between such progress and other topics of traditional statistical physics. The
main theme of the review is to show diverse emergent properties of the
laboratory markets, originating from self-organization due to the nonlinear
interactions among heterogeneous humans or agents (complexity).

We introduce the point-curve-surface complex (PCS complex), a cell complex
tailored for a canonical
decomposition of regular non-manifold two-dimensional topological spaces
(i.e., the class of topological
spaces that admits a simplicial 2-complex decomposition). PCS complexes are
obtained by gluing together
points, curves and surfaces, very similarly to CW complexes, except that the
cells are not restricted to be
topological disks. Also, gluing constraints that cells must satisfy to form a
valid complex are much stricter
than with CW complexes. We conjecture that this specific combination of
exibility and constraints ensures
uniqueness of a minimal decomposition, obtained via atomic simplifications
performed in any order.

*****
Conventional approaches to sampling signals or images follow Shannon’s cel-
ebrated theorem: the sampling rate must be at least twice the maximum fre-
quency present in the signal (the so-called Nyquist rate). In fact, this
principle underlies nearly all signal acquisition protocols used in consumer
audio and visual electronics, medical imaging devices, radio receivers, and
so on. (For some signals, such as images that are not naturally bandlimited,
the sam-
pling rate is dictated not by the Shannon theorem but by the desired temporal
or spatial
resolution. However, it is common in such systems to use an antialiasing
low-pass filter
to bandlimit the signal before sampling, and so the Shannon theorem plays an
implicit
role.) In the field of data conversion, for example, standard
analog-to-digital converter
(ADC) technology implements the usual quantized Shannon representation: the
signal is
uniformly sampled at or above the Nyquist rate.

This article surveys the theory of compressive sampling, also
known as compressed sensing or CS, a novel sensing/sampling
paradigm that goes against the common wisdom in data acquisi-
tion. CS theory asserts that one can recover certain signals and
images from far fewer samples or measurements than tradition-
al methods use. To make this possible, CS relies on two
principles:
sparsity,
which pertains to the signals of interest, and
incoherence,
which pertains to the sensing modality.

This article offers an accessible but rigorous and essentially self-contained
account of some of the central ideas in compressed sensing, aimed at
nonspecialists and undergraduates who have had linear algebra and some
probability. The basic premise is first illustrated by considering the problem
of detecting a few defective items in a large set. We then build up the
mathematical framework of compressed sensing to show how combining efficient
sampling methods with elementary ideas from linear algebra and a bit of
approximation theory, optimization, and probability allows the estimation of
unknown quantities with far less sampling of data than traditional methods.

*****
The emergence of synchronization in a network of coupled oscillators is a
fascinating subject of multidisciplinary research. This survey reviews the
vast literature on the theory and the applications of complex oscillator
networks. We focus on phase oscillator models that are widespread in
real-world synchronization phenomena, that generalize the celebrated Kuramoto
model, and that feature a rich phenomenology. We review the history and the
countless applications of this model throughout science and engineering. We
justify the importance of the widespread coupled oscillator model as a locally
canonical model and describe some selected applications relevant to control
scientists, including vehicle coordination, electric power networks, and clock
synchronization. We introduce the reader to several synchronization notions
and performance estimates. We propose analysis approaches to phase and
frequency synchronization, phase balancing, pattern formation, and partial
synchronization. We present the sharpest known results about synchronization
in networks of homogeneous and heterogeneous oscillators, with complete or
sparse interconnection topologies, and in finite-dimensional and
infinite-dimensional settings. We conclude by summarizing the limitations of
existing analysis methods and by highlighting some directions for future
research.

Feedback is an ancient idea, but feedback control is a young field. Nature
long ago discovered feedback since it is essential for homeostasis and life.
It was the key for harnessing power in the industrial revolution and is today
found everywhere around us. Its development as a field involved contributions
from engineers, mathematicians, economists and physicists. It is the first
systems discipline; it represented a paradigm shift because it cut across the
traditional engineering disciplines of aeronautical, chemical, civil,
electrical and mechanical engineering, as well as economics and operations
research. The scope of control makes it the quintessential multidisciplinary
field. Its complex story of evolution is fascinating, and a perspective on its
growth is presented in this paper. The interplay of industry, applications,
technology, theory and research is discussed.

*****
[small]#Prediction models that capture and use the structure of state-space dynamics
can be very effective. In practice, however, one rarely has access to full
information about that structure, and accurate reconstruction of the dynamics
from scalar time-series data---e.g., via delay-coordinate embedding---can be a
real challenge. In this paper, we show that forecast models that employ
incomplete embeddings of the dynamics can produce surprisingly accurate
predictions of the state of a dynamical system. In particular, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of a simple near-neighbor forecast technique that works with
a two-dimensional embedding. Even though correctness of the topology is not
guaranteed for incomplete reconstructions like this, the dynamical structure
that they capture allows for accurate predictions---in many cases, even more
accurate than predictions generated using a full embedding. This could be very
useful in the context of real-time forecasting, where the human effort
required to produce a correct delay-coordinate embedding is prohibitive.#

Complex Systems:  A Survey (paper, PDF, 10) -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1440[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1440+]

*****
A complex system is a system composed of many interacting parts, often called
agents, which displays collective behavior that does not follow trivially from
the behaviors of the individual parts. Examples include condensed matter
systems, ecosystems, stock markets and economies, biological evolution, and
indeed the whole of human society. Substantial progress has been made in the
quantitative understanding of complex systems, particularly since the 1980s,
using a combination of basic theory, much of it derived from physics, and
computer simulation. The subject is a broad one, drawing on techniques and
ideas from a wide range of areas. Here I give a survey of the main themes and
methods of complex systems science and an annotated bibliography of resources,
ranging from classic papers to recent books and reviews.

Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf's law (paper, PDF, 28) -
http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0412004v3[+http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0412004v3+]

*****
When the probability of measuring a particular value of some quantity varies
inversely as a power of that value, the quantity is said to follow a power
law, also known variously as Zipf's law or the Pareto distribution. Power laws
appear widely in physics, biology, earth and planetary sciences, economics and
finance, computer science, demography and the social sciences. For instance,
the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, solar flares, moon
craters, wars and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws.
The origin of power-law behaviour has been a topic of debate in the scientific
community for more than a century. Here we review some of the empirical
evidence for the existence of power-law forms and the theories proposed to
explain them.

Hypercomputation: computing more than the Turing machine (paper, PDF, 2002, 57) - Toby Ord - 
http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0209332[+http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0209332+]

*****
Due to common misconceptions about the Church-Turing thesis, it has been
widely assumed that the Turing machine provides an upper bound on what is
computable. This is not so. The new field of hypercomputation studies models
of computation that can compute more than the Turing machine and addresses
their implications. In this report, I survey much of the work that has been
done on hypercomputation, explaining how such non-classical models fit into
the classical theory of computation and comparing their relative powers. I
also examine the physical requirements for such machines to be constructible
and the kinds of hypercomputation that may be possible within the universe.
Finally, I show how the possibility of hypercomputation weakens the impact of
Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and Chaitin's discovery of 'randomness' within
arithmetic.

*****
I discuss several aspects of information theory and its relationship to
physics and neuroscience. The unifying thread of this somewhat chaotic essay
is the concept of Kolmogorov or algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov Complexity,
for short). I argue that it is natural to interpret cognition as the art of
finding algorithms that apprach the Solomonoff-Kolmogorov-Chaitin
(algorithmic) Complexity limit with appropriate tradeoffs. In addition, I
claim that what we call the universe is an interpreted abstraction--a mental
construct--based on the observed coherence between multiple sensory input
streams and our own interactions. Hence, the notion of Universe is itself a
model.

Computational science and re-discovery: open-source implementations of
ellipsoidal harmonics for problems in potential theory (paper, PDF, 2012, 25) - J. P. Bardhan & M. G. Knepley -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0267[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0267+]

*****
We present two open-source (BSD) implementations of ellipsoidal harmonic
expansions for solving problems of potential theory using separation of
variables. Ellipsoidal harmonics are used surprisingly infrequently,
considering their substantial value for problems ranging in scale from
molecules to the entire solar system. In this article, we suggest two possible
reasons for the paucity relative to spherical harmonics. The first is
essentially historical---ellipsoidal harmonics developed during the late 19th
century and early 20th, when it was found that only the lowest-order harmonics
are expressible in closed form. Each higher-order term requires the solution
of an eigenvalue problem, and tedious manual computation seems to have
discouraged applications and theoretical studies. The second explanation is
practical: even with modern computers and accurate eigenvalue algorithms,
expansions in ellipsoidal harmonics are significantly more challenging to
compute than those in Cartesian or spherical coordinates. The present
implementations reduce the "barrier to entry" by providing an easy and free
way for the community to begin using ellipsoidal harmonics in actual research.
We demonstrate our implementation using the specific and physiologically
crucial problem of how charged proteins interact with their environment, and
ask: what other analytical tools await re-discovery in an era of inexpensive
computation?

Solving ordinary differential equations on the Infinity Computer by working
with infinitesimals numerically (paper, PDF, 2013, 25) - Y. D. Sergeyev
http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3529[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3529+]

*****
There exists a huge number of numerical methods that iteratively construct
approximations to the solution y(x) of an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
y′(x)=f(x,y) starting from an initial value y0=y(x0) and using a finite
approximation step h that influences the accuracy of the obtained
approximation. In this paper, a new framework for solving ODEs is presented
for a new kind of a computer -- the Infinity Computer (it has been patented
and its working prototype exists). The new computer is able to work
numerically with finite, infinite, and infinitesimal numbers giving so the
possibility to use different infinitesimals numerically and, in particular, to
take advantage of infinitesimal values of h. To show the potential of the new
framework a number of results is established. It is proved that the Infinity
Computer is able to calculate derivatives of the solution y(x) and to
reconstruct its Taylor expansion of a desired order numerically without
finding the respective derivatives analytically (or symbolically) by the
successive derivation of the ODE as it is usually done when the Taylor method
is applied. Methods using approximations of derivatives obtained thanks to
infinitesimals are discussed and a technique for an automatic control of
rounding errors is introduced. Numerical examples are given.

This survey provides an overview of higher-order tensor decompositions, their
applications, and available software. A tensor is a multidimensional or N -way
array. Decompositions of higher-order tensors (i.e., N -way arrays with N
â¥ 3) have applications in psychometrics, chemometrics, signal processing,
numerical linear algebra, computer vision, numerical analysis, data mining,
neuroscience, graph analysis, etc. Two particular tensor decompositions can be
considered to be higher-order extensions of the matrix singular value decompo-
sition: CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposes a tensor as a sum of rank-one
tensors, and the Tucker decomposition is a higher-order form of principal
components analysis. There are many other tensor decompositions, including
INDSCAL, PARAFAC2, CANDELINC, DEDICOM, and PARATUCK2 as well as nonnegative
variants of all of the above. The N-way Toolbox and Tensor Toolbox, both for
MATLAB, and the Multilinear Engine are examples of software packages for
working with tensors.

http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0508341[+http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0508341+]

*****
We present a theory and applications of discrete exterior calculus on
simplicial complexes of arbitrary finite dimension. This can be thought of as
calculus on a discrete space. Our theory includes not only discrete
differential forms but also discrete vector fields and the operators acting on
these objects. This allows us to address the various interactions between
forms and vector fields (such as Lie derivatives) which are important in
applications. Previous attempts at discrete exterior calculus have addressed
only differential forms. We also introduce the notion of a circumcentric dual
of a simplicial complex. The importance of dual complexes in this field has
been well understood, but previous researchers have used barycentric
subdivision or barycentric duals. We show that the use of circumcentric duals
is crucial in arriving at a theory of discrete exterior calculus that admits
both vector fields and forms.

*****
The computational methods currently used in physics are based on the
discretization of differential equations. This is because the computer can
only perform algebraic operations. The purpose of this paper is to critically
review this practice, showing how to obtain a purely algebraic formulation of
physical laws starting directly from experimental measurements. In other
words, we can get an algebraic formulation avoiding any arbitrary process of
discretization of differential equations. This formulation has the great merit
of maintaining close contact between the mathematical description and the
physical phenomenon described.

*****
We describe discretisations of the shallow-water equations on the sphere using
the framework of finite element exterior calculus, which are extensions of the
mimetic finite difference framework.  The exterior calculus notation provides
a guide to which finite element spaces should be used for which physical
variables, and unifies a number of desirable properties. We present two
formulations: a “primal” formulation in which the finite element spaces are
defined on a single mesh, and a “primal–dual” formulation in which finite
element spaces on a dual mesh are also used. Both formulations have velocity
and layer depth as prognostic variables, but the exterior calculus framework
leads to a conserved diagnostic potential vorticity. In both formulations we
show how to construct discretisations that have mass-consistent (constant
potential vorticity stays constant), stable and oscillation-free potential
vorticity advection.

examples and enable a physical intuition of these concepts for those who are

*****
Preserving in the discrete realm the underlying geometric, topological, and
algebraic structures at stake in partial differential equations has proven to
be a fruitful guiding principle for numerical methods in a variety of fields
such as elasticity, electromagnetism, or fluid mechanics. However,
structure-preserving methods have traditionally used spaces of piecewise
polynomial basis functions for differential forms. Yet, in many problems where
solutions are smoothly varying in space, a spectral numerical treatment is
called for. In an effort to provide structure-preserving numerical tools with
spectral accuracy on logically rectangular grids over periodic or bounded
domains, we present a spectral extension of the discrete exterior calculus
(DEC), with resulting computational tools extending well-known
collocation-based spectral methods. Its efficient implementation using fast
Fourier transforms is provided as well.

*****
The mimetic finite difference (MFD) method mimics fundamental properties of
mathematical and physical systems including conservation laws, symmetry and
positivity of solutions, duality and self-adjointness of differential
operators, and exact mathematical identities of the vector and tensor
calculus. This article is the first comprehensive review of the 50-year long
history of the mimetic methodology and describes in a systematic way the major
mimetic ideas and their relevance to academic and real-life problems. The
supporting applications include diffusion, electromagnetics, fluid flow, and
Lagrangian hydrodynamics problems. The article provides enough details to
build various discrete operators on unstructured polygonal and polyhedral
meshes and summarizes the major convergence results for the mimetic
approximations. Most of these theoretical results, which are presented here as
lemmas, propositions and theorems, are either original or an extension of
existing results to a more general formulation using polyhedral meshes.
Finally, flexibility and extensibility of the mimetic methodology are shown by
deriving higher-order approximations, enforcing discrete maximum principles
for diffusion problems, and ensuring the numerical stability for saddle-point
systems.

A Survey of the Development of Geometry up to 1870 (paper, PDF, 108, 2014) -
Eldar Straume -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1140[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1140+]

*****
This is an expository treatise on the development of the classical geometries,
starting from the origins of Euclidean geometry a few centuries BC up to
around 1870. At this time classical differential geometry came to an end, and
the Riemannian geometric approach started to be developed. Moreover, the
discovery of non-Euclidean geometry, about 40 years earlier, had just been
demonstrated to be a "true" geometry on the same footing as Euclidean
geometry. These were radically new ideas, but henceforth the importance of the
topic became gradually realized. As a consequence, the conventional attitude
to the basic geometric questions, including the possible geometric structure
of the physical space, was challenged, and foundational problems became an
important issue during the following decades. Such a basic understanding of
the status of geometry around 1870 enables one to study the geometric works of
Sophus Lie and Felix Klein at the beginning of their career in the appropriate
historical perspective.

With the introduction of free-standing stones in Britain during the Late
Neolithic, there was a significant change in the lithification of people's
cosmology. Such monuments continued to be erected across Britain almost until
the end of the Bronze Age. It has been empirically verified that for many
Bronze Age monuments erected in Scotland between 1400-900 BC, there is a
common set of complex landscape and astronomical patternings. However, when
and where these patterns were first introduced through standing-stone
structures was unknown. Here we show that the visible astronomical-landscape
variables found at Bronze Age sites on the inner isles and mainland of western
Scotland were first established nearly two millennia earlier, with the
erection of the first standing-stone 'great circles' in Britain: Callanish and
Stenness of Scotland.

The quest for finding the right interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (QM) is as

answered. We raise it and answer it.
Then the quest for the right interpretation can continue self-consciously, for
we then know exactly what we are after. We present a list of minimal
requirements that something has to meet in order to qualify as an
interpretation of QM. We also raise, as a side issue, the question how the
discourse on the interpretation of QM relates to hermeneutics in Continental
Philosophy.

On Symmetry and Conserved Quantities in Classical Mechanics (paper, PDF, 2005,
60) - Jeremy Butterfield -
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0507192[+http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0507192+]

*****
This paper expounds the relations between continuous symmetries and conserved
quantities, i.e. Noether's ``first theorem'', in both the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian frameworks for classical mechanics. This illustrates one of
mechanics' grand themes: exploiting a symmetry so as to reduce the number of
variables needed to treat a problem.
I emphasise that, for both frameworks, the theorem is underpinned by the idea
of cyclic coordinates; and that the Hamiltonian theorem is more powerful. The
Lagrangian theorem's main ``ingredient'', apart from cyclic coordinates, is
the rectification of vector fields afforded by the local existence and
uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations. For the
Hamiltonian theorem, the main extra ingredients are the asymmetry of the
Poisson bracket, and the fact that a vector field generates canonical
transformations iff it is Hamiltonian.

The twentieth century saw two fundamental revolutions in physics -- relativity

immense empirical success. Does their instrumental effectiveness stand on the
rock of secure concepts or the sand of unresolved fundamentals? Does measuring
a quantum system probe, or even create, reality, or merely change belief? Must
relativity and quantum theory just co-exist or might we find a new theory
which unifies the two? To bring such questions into sharper focus, we convened
a conference on Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality. Some issues remain
as controversial as ever, but some are being nudged by theory's secret weapon
of experiment.

On Symplectic Reduction in Classical Mechanics (paper, PDF, 2005, 131) -
Jeremy Butterfield -
http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0507194[+http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0507194+]

*****
This paper expounds the modern theory of symplectic reduction in
finite-dimensional Hamiltonian mechanics. This theory generalizes the
well-known connection between continuous symmetries and conserved quantities,
i.e. Noether's theorem. It also illustrates one of mechanics' grand themes:
exploiting a symmetry so as to reduce the number of variables needed to treat
a problem. The exposition emphasises how the theory provides insights about
the rotation group and the rigid body. The theory's device of quotienting a
state space also casts light on philosophical issues about whether two
apparently distinct but utterly indiscernible possibilities should be ruled to
be one and the same. These issues are illustrated using ``relationist''
mechanics.

allowed by supersymmetry of the elementary particles. We give a non-technical

In contemporary theoretical physics, the powerful notion of symmetry stands
for a web of intricate meanings among which I identify four clusters
associated with the notion of transformation, comprehension, invariance and
projection. While their interrelations are examined closely, these four facets
of symmetry are scrutinised one after the other in great detail. This
decomposition allows us to examine closely the multiple different roles
symmetry plays in many places in physics. Furthermore, some connections with
others disciplines like neurobiology, epistemology, cognitive sciences and,
not least, philosophy are proposed in an attempt to show that symmetry can be
an organising principle also in these fields.

We use symmetry to discuss the objectivity of mathematics, the role of
mathematical objects, the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and the

*****
I argue that the laws of physics should be independent of one's choice of
units or measuring apparatus. This is the case if they are framed in terms of
dimensionless numbers such as the fine structure constant, alpha. For example,
the Standard Model of particle physics has 19 such dimensionless parameters
whose values all observers can agree on, irrespective of what clock, rulers,
scales... they use to measure them. Dimensional constants, on the other hand,
such as h, c, G, e, k..., are merely human constructs whose number and values
differ from one choice of units to the next. In this sense only dimensionless
constants are "fundamental". Similarly, the possible time variation of
dimensionless fundamental "constants" of nature is operationally well-defined
and a legitimate subject of physical enquiry. By contrast, the time variation
of dimensional constants such as c or G on which a good many (in my opinion,
confusing) papers have been written, is a unit-dependent phenomenon on which
different observers might disagree depending on their apparatus. All these
confusions disappear if one asks only unit-independent questions.
We provide a selection of opposing opinions in the literature and respond
accordingly.

In this mostly pedagogical tutorial article a brief introduction to modern
geometrical treatment of fluid dynamics and electrodynamics is provided. The
main technical tool is standard theory of differential forms. In fluid
dynamics, the approach is based on general theory of integral invariants (due
to Poincare and Cartan). Since this stuff is still not considered common
knowledge, the first chapter is devoted to an introductory and self-contained
exposition of both Poincare version as well as Cartan's extension of the
theory. The main emphasis in fluid dynamics part of the text is on explaining
basic classical results on vorticity phenomenon (vortex lines, vortex
filaments etc.) in ideal fluid. In electrodynamics part, we stress the aspect
of how different (in particular, rotating) observers perceive the same
space-time situation. Suitable 3+1 decomposition technique of differential
forms proves to be useful for that. As a representative (an simple) example we
analyze Faraday's law of induction (and explicitly compute the induced
voltage) from this point of view.

These are lecture notes for a course on the theory of Clifford algebras, with
special emphasis on their wide range of applications in mathematics and
physics. Clifford algebra is introduced both through a conventional tensor
algebra construction (then called geometric algebra) with geometric
applications in mind, as well as in an algebraically more general form which
is well suited for combinatorics, and for defining and understanding the
numerous products and operations of the algebra. The various applications
presented include vector space and projective geometry, orthogonal maps and
spinors, normed division algebras, as well as simplicial complexes and graph
theory.

Historically, there have been many attempts to produce the appropriate
mathematical formalism for modeling the nature of physical space, such as
Euclid's geometry, Descartes' system of Cartesian coordinates, the Argand
plane, Hamilton's quaternions, Gibbs' vector system using the dot and cross
products. We illustrate however, that Clifford's geometric algebra (GA)
provides the most elegant description of physical space. Supporting this
conclusion, we firstly show how geometric algebra subsumes the key elements of
the competing formalisms and secondly we show how it provides an intuitive
representation and manipulation of the basic concepts of points, lines, areas
and volumes. We also provide two examples where GA has been found to provide
an improved description of two key physical phenomena, electromagnetism and
quantum theory, without using tensors or complex vector spaces. This paper
also provides pedagogical tutorial-style coverage of the various basic
applications of geometric algebra in physics.

*****
In 2008, researchers at HP Labs published a paper in {\it Nature} reporting
the realisation of a new basic circuit element that completes the missing link
between charge and flux-linkage, which was postulated by Leon Chua in 1971.
The HP memristor is based on a nanometer scale TiO2 thin-film, containing a
doped region and an undoped region. Further to proposed applications of
memristors in artificial biological systems and nonvolatile RAM (NVRAM), they
also enable reconfigurable nanoelectronics. Moreover, memristors provide new
paradigms in application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). A significant reduction in area with an
unprecedented memory capacity and device density are the potential advantages
of memristors for Integrated Circuits (ICs). This work reviews the memristor
and provides mathematical and SPICE models for memristors. Insight into the
memristor device is given via recalling the quasi-static expansion of
Maxwell's equations. We also review Chua's arguments based on electromagnetic
theory.

Universal geometric calculus simplifies and unifies the structure and notation
of mathematics for all of science and engineering, and for technological
applications. This paper treats the fundamentals of the multivector
differential calculus part of geometric calculus. The multivector differential
is introduced, followed by the multivector derivative and the adjoint of
multivector functions. The basic rules of multivector differentiation are
derived explicitly, as well as a variety of basic multivector derivatives.
Finally factorization, which relates functions of vector variables and
multivector variables is discussed, and the concepts of both simplicial
variables and derivatives are explained. Everything is proven explicitly in a
very elementary level step by step approach. The paper is thus intended to
serve as reference material, providing a number of details, which are usually
skipped in more advanced discussions of the subject matter.

Geometric algebra (paper, PDF, 2012, 92) - Eric Chisolm -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5935[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5935+]

*****
This is an introduction to geometric algebra, an alternative to traditional
vector algebra that expands on it in two ways: (1) In addition to scalars and
vectors, it defines new objects representing subspaces of any dimension; (2)
It defines a product that's strongly motivated by geometry and can be taken
between any two objects. For example, the product of two vectors taken in a
certain way represents their common plane. 
This system was invented by William Clifford and is more commonly known as
Clifford algebra. It's actually older than the vector algebra that we use
today (due to Gibbs) and includes it as a subset. Over the years, various
parts of Clifford algebra have been reinvented independently by many people
who found they needed it, often not realizing that all those parts belonged in
one system. This suggests that Clifford had the right idea, and that geometric
algebra, not the reduced version we use today, deserves to be the standard
"vector algebra." My goal in these notes is to describe geometric algebra from
that standpoint and illustrate its usefulness. The notes are work in progress;
I'll keep adding new topics as I learn them myself.

demonstrated the potential power of quantum computation. Each step of the

horizontal ground using the duration of daylight and the length of a shadow at

*****
Introducing Clifford algebra as the mathematical foundation, a unified
spatio-temporal data model and hierarchical spatio-temporal index are
constructed by linking basic data objects, like pointclouds and
Spatio-Temporal Hyper Cubes of different dimensions, within the multivector
structure of Clifford algebra. The transformation from geographic space into
homogeneous and conformal space means that geometric, metric and many other
kinds of operators of Clifford algebra can be implemented and we then design
the shortest path, high-dimensional Voronoi and unified spatial-temporal
process analyses with spacetime algebra. Tests with real world data suggest
these traditional GIS analysis algorithms can be extended and constructed
under Clifford Algebra framework, which can accommodate multiple dimensions.
The prototype software system CAUSTA (Clifford Algebra based Unified
Spatial-Temporal Analysis) provides a useful tool for investigating and
modeling the distribution characteristics and dynamic process of complex
geographical phenomena under the unified spatio-temporal structure.

*****
It is suggested that the scalar imaginary i that is used so extensively in
physics and signal analysis is not ideal for revealing symmetries of real
systems and there is value in replacing it with real matrix operators iT, iX,
etc that may be different for each dimension. A Clifford algebra in the space
of even and odd signals is used to develop a novel real Fourier analysis that
substantially replicates a complex Fourier analysis, but shows how even and
odd symmetries propagate/change in systems. The matrix values of iT, iX, etc
give real rotations between even and odd symmetries in their associated
dimensions and have negative unit square values. A few simple examples are
discussed such as linear differential equations for the harmonic oscillator,
maintenance of even and odd symmetries in quantum theory and how different
operators such as iT, iX, etc commute enabling a single (matrix) i to appear
in spacetime wave analysis.

I present the age-old mathematics of the sundial from a new perspective.
Standard approaches consider the problem in the Earth frame and focus on
spherical geometry. In this work, I apply a more physical approach, based on
geometric algebra, to the generalized sundial problem of calculating the
position of the tip of the shadow of a gnomon on a flat dial surface, both of
which can have arbitrary orientation. This results in both an exact expression
for the equation of time and formulae for the shadow tip which reduce to
standard results for the special cases of common dial types.

We express the position of the Sun in the sky as a function of time and the

matrices to vectors describing points on the celestial sphere. We also derive
direct expressions, as functions of date of the year and geographic latitude,
for the duration of daylight, the maximum and minimum altitudes of the Sun,
and the cardinal directions to sunrise and sunset. We discuss how to account
for the eccentricity of the earth's orbit, the precessions of the equinoxes
and the perihelion, the size of the solar disk, and atmospheric refraction. We
illustrate these results by computing the dates of "Manhattanhenge" (when
sunset aligns with the east-west streets on the main traffic grid for
Manhattan, in New York City), by plotting the altitude of the Sun over
representative cities as a function of time, and by showing plots
("analemmas") for the position of the Sun in the sky at a given hour of the

world we live in. Such a mathematical world is presented is this paper. It is
a world which can be explained to and understood by learners much easier than
the usual obscured world full of imaginaries. And it is a geometrical world,

Traditional vectors as an introduction to geometric

*****
The 2002 Oersted Medal Lecture by David Hestenes concerns the many advantages
for education in physics if geometric algebra were to replace standard vector
algebra. However, such a change has difficulties for those who have been
taught traditionally. A new way of introducing geometric algebra is presented
here using a four-element array composed of traditional vector and scalar
products. This leads to an explicit 4 × 4 matrix representation which contains
key requirements for three-dimensional geometric algebra. The work can be
extended to include Maxwell's equations where it is found that curl and
divergence appear naturally together. However, to obtain an explicit
representation of space–time algebra with the correct behaviour under Lorentz
transformations, an 8 × 8 matrix representation has to be formed. This leads
to a Dirac representation of Maxwell's equations showing that space–time
algebra has hidden within its formalism the symmetry of 'parity, charge
conjugation and time reversal'.

Cross-language Babel structs—making scientific interfaces more efficient -

Babel is an open-source language interoperability framework tailored to the
needs of high-performance scientific computing. As an integral element of the
Common Component Architecture, it is employed in a wide range of scientific
applications where it is used to connect components written in different
programming languages. In this paper we describe how we extended Babel to
support interoperable tuple data types (structs). Structs are a common idiom
in (mono-lingual) scientific application programming interfaces (APIs); they
are an efficient way to pass tuples of nonuniform data between functions, and
are supported natively by most programming languages. Using our extended
version of Babel, developers of scientific codes can now pass structs as
arguments between functions implemented in any of the supported languages. In
C, C++, Fortran 2003/2008 and Chapel, structs can be passed without the
overhead of data marshaling or copying, providing language interoperability at
minimal cost. Other supported languages are Fortran 77, Fortran 90/95, Java
and Python. We will show how we designed a struct implementation that is
interoperable with all of the supported languages and present benchmark data
to compare the performance of all language bindings, highlighting the
differences between languages that offer native struct support and an
object-oriented interface with getter/setter methods. A case study shows how
structs can help simplify the interfaces of scientific codes significantly.

The three-body problem, which describes three masses interacting through
Newtonian gravity without any restrictions imposed on the initial positions
and velocities of these masses, has attracted the attention of many scientists
for more than 300 years. In this paper, we present a review of the three-body
problem in the context of both historical and modern developments. We describe
the general and restricted (circular and elliptic) three-body problems,
different analytical and numerical methods of finding solutions, methods for
performing stability analysis and searching for periodic orbits and
resonances. We apply the results to some interesting problems of celestial
mechanics. We also provide a brief presentation of the general and restricted
relativistic three-body problems, and discuss their astronomical applications.

deep areas of mathematics such as Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem. Could such
properties also provide new perspectives on deep unsolved issues in

This paper presents recent work on connections between symmetries and
conservation laws. After reviewing Noether's theorem and its limitations, we
present the Direct Construction Method to show how to find directly the
conservation laws for any given system of differential equations. This method
yields the multipliers for conservation laws as well as an integral formula
for corresponding conserved densities. The action of a symmetry (discrete or
continuous) on a conservation law yields conservation laws. Conservation laws
yield non-locally related systems that, in turn, can yield nonlocal symmetries
and in addition be useful for the application of other mathematical methods.
From its admitted symmetries or multipliers for conservation laws, one can
determine whether or not a given system of differential equations can be
linearized by an invertible transformation.

We present the multiplier method of constructing conservative finite
difference schemes for ordinary and partial differential equations. Given a
system of differential equations possessing conservation laws, our approach is
based on discretizing conservation law multipliers and their associated
density and flux functions. We show that the proposed discretization is
consistent for any order of accuracy and that by construction, discrete
densities can be exactly conserved. In particular, the multiplier method does
not require the system to possess a Hamiltonian or variational structure.
Examples, including dissipative problems, are given to illustrate the method.

Navier-Stokes Hamiltonian (paper, PDF, 2014, 42) - Billy D. Jones -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1035[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1035+]

*****
The Navier-Stokes Hamiltonian is derived from first principles. Its Hamilton
equations are shown to be equivalent to the Navier-Stokes, continuity, and
energy conservation equations of standard fluid mechanics. The derivations of
the Navier-Stokes and Euler Hamiltonians are compared, with the latter having
identical dynamics to the Euler equation with the viscosity terms dropped from
the beginning. The two Hamiltonians have the same number of degrees of freedom
in three spatial dimensions: six independent scalar potentials (although in
the Navier-Stokes case the potentials are two vector fields), but their
dynamical fields are necessarily different due to a theory with dissipation
not mapping smoothly onto one without. Mass, momentum, and energy conservation
give rise to the standard nonholonomic constraint on entropy which is used to
construct the Navier-Stokes Hamiltonian. The Newton, Euler-Lagrange, and
Hamilton sets of equations are shown to be equivalent for both of these Euler
and Navier-Stokes fluids. The dynamical coordinate field of a dissipative
fluid is a vector field that stores the initial position of all the fluid
particles. Thus these appear to be natural coordinates for studying arbitrary
separations of fluid particles over time. The final section discusses energy
conservation of the Navier-Stokes Hamiltonian and derives its Poisson bracket
with a general classical dissipative observable to set up later work with the
similarity renormalization group.

*****
The flow of a viscous fluid is perturbed by its internal friction which
generates heat and leads to a small temperature change. This does not occur
for an ideal fluid. We would like to resolve this picture as a function of the
dynamical macroscopic scales of both problems. In order to do this we will
study the evolution of the Navier-Stokes Hamiltonian with the classical
similarity renormalization group in the region of small viscosity. The
connection between the Euler and Navier-Stokes fluids will be pursued, but
also the viscous structures that arise will be studied in their own right to
determine the low-order velocity correlators of realistic fluids such as
single-component air and water. The canonical coordinate of the Navier-Stokes
Hamiltonian is a vector field that stores the initial position of all the
fluid particles. Thus these appear to be natural coordinates for studying
arbitrary separations of fluid particles over time. This connection will be
pursued and the region where the classic 1926 Richardson 4/3 scaling law holds
will be determined. The evolution of the Euler Hamiltonian will also be
studied and we will attempt to map its singular structures to those of the
small-viscosity Navier-Stokes fluid.

*****
Originally introduced in the fluid mechanics community, dynamic mode
decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics
of nonlinear systems. However, existing DMD theory deals primarily with
sequential time series for which the measurement dimension is much larger than
the number of measurements taken. We present a theoretical framework in which
we define DMD as the eigendecomposition of an approximating linear operator.
This generalizes DMD to a larger class of datasets, including nonsequential
time series. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by presenting novel
sampling strategies that increase computational efficiency and mitigate the
effects of noise, respectively. We also introduce the concept of linear
consistency, which helps explain the potential pitfalls of applying DMD to
rank-deficient datasets, illustrating with examples. Such computations are not
considered in the existing literature, but can be understood using our more
general framework. In addition, we show that our theory strengthens the
connections between DMD and Koopman operator theory. It also establishes
connections between DMD and other techniques, including the eigensystem
realization algorithm (ERA), a system identification method, and linear
inverse modeling (LIM), a method from climate science. We show that under
certain conditions, DMD is equivalent to LIM.

Data-Driven Reduction for Multiscale Stochastic Dynamical
Systems (paper, PDF, 2015, 22) - Carmeline J. Dsilva et al. -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05195[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05195+]

*****
Multiple time scale stochastic dynamical systems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, and the reduction of such systems and their models to only their
slow components is often essential for scientific computation and further
analysis. Rather than being available in the form of an explicit analytical
model, often such systems can only be observed as a data set which exhibits
dynamics on several time scales. We will focus on applying and adapting data
mining and manifold learning techniques to detect the slow components in such
multiscale data. Traditional data mining methods are based on metrics (and
thus, geometries) which are not informed of the multiscale nature of the
underlying system dynamics; such methods cannot successfully recover the slow
variables. Here, we present an approach which utilizes both the local geometry
and the local dynamics within the data set through a metric which is both
insensitive to the fast variables and more general than simple statistical
averaging. Our analysis of the approach provides conditions for successfully
recovering the underlying slow variables, as well as an empirical protocol
guiding the selection of the method parameters.

A Data-Driven Approximation of the Koopman Operator: Extending Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (paper, PDF, 2014, 34) - Matthew O. Williams et al. -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4408[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4408+]

*****
The Koopman operator is a linear but infinite dimensional operator that
governs the evolution of scalar observables defined on the state space of an
autonomous dynamical system, and is a powerful tool for the analysis and
decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this manuscript, we present a
data driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions,
and modes of the Koopman operator. The method requires a data set of snapshot
pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit
governing equations or interaction with a "black box" integrator. We will show
that this approach is, in effect, an extension of Dynamic Mode Decomposition
(DMD), which has been used to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes.
Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov
process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm
approximates the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which
could be considered as the "stochastic Koopman operator" [1]. Finally, four
illustrative examples are presented: two that highlight the quantitative
performance of the method when presented with either deterministic or
stochastic data, and two that show potential applications of the Koopman
eigenfunctions.

Data Fusion via Intrinsic Dynamic Variables: An Application of Data-Driven
Koopman Spectral Analysis (paper, PDF, 2014, 8) - Matthew O. Williams et al. -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5424[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5424+]

*****
We demonstrate that numerically computed approximations of Koopman
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues create a natural framework for data fusion in
applications governed by nonlinear evolution laws. This is possible because
the eigenvalues of the Koopman operator are invariant to invertible
transformations of the system state, so that the values of the Koopman
eigenfunctions serve as a set of intrinsic coordinates that can be used to map
between different observations (e.g., measurements obtained through different
sets of sensors) of the same fundamental behavior. The measurements we wish to
merge can also be nonlinear, but must be "rich enough" to allow (an effective
approximation of) the state to be reconstructed from a single set of
measurements. This approach requires independently obtained sets of data that
capture the evolution of the heterogeneous measurements and a single pair of
"joint" measurements taken at one instance in time. Computational
approximations of eigenfunctions and their corresponding eigenvalues from data
are accomplished using Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. We illustrate this
approach on measurements of spatio-temporal oscillations of the
FitzHugh-Nagumo PDE, and show how to fuse point measurements with principal
component measurements, after which either set of measurements can be used to
estimate the other set.

*****
A majority of methods from dynamical systems analysis, especially those in
applied settings, rely on Poincare's geometric picture that focuses on
"dynamics of states". While this picture has fueled our field for a century,
it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and
uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design
and analysis of "big data" measurements.
This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems,
based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the
Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless
capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper
is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts
all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator.
The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort
to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them,
but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map
through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail.
We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman
eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept we
provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them,
numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when
possible, applications that made use of them.
The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and
theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its
strengths, in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas
where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as
an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.

*****
The future state of a dynamical system depends on the initial conditions,
model errors, model parameters, and boundary conditions. Insufficient
knowledge of these parameters leads to uncertainty in estimation and
prediction of the system states. Data assimilation involves blending
information from observations of the actual system states with information
from dynamical models to estimate the current system states or certain model
parameters. In this paper, we consider the data assimilation problem for
multi-timescale systems, i.e., systems with inherent slow-fast dynamics with
wide timescale separations. We present a particle filtering algorithm for
multiscale systems, with an application to the Lorenz'96 model. The Lorenz'96
model is a system that mimics mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics and is
regularly used as a testbed for data assimilation methods for high-dimensional
chaotic systems. The particle filtering algorithm, the homogenized hybrid
particle filter (HHPF), was developed based on the theoretical result that
combined stochastic averaging with filtering theory to construct a
reduced-dimension nonlinear filter for a high-dimensional multiscale system.
In the context of filtering applications, the reduced-order filter facilitates
the estimation of the slow dynamics without requiring the explicit knowledge
of the fast dynamics, hence reducing computational complexities and
information storage requirements. In the application to the Lorenz'96 model,
the HHPF is shown to have the advantage of shorter computational time compared
to existing nonlinear filtering methods with comparable level of estimation
accuracy.

Fourier analyses* (paper, PDF, 2011, 28) -
http://cwrowley.princeton.edu/papers/ChenDMD10.pdf[+http://cwrowley.princeton.edu/papers/ChenDMD10.pdf+]

*****
Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is an Arnoldi-like method based on the
Koopman
operator that analyzes empirical data, typically generated by nonlinear
dynamics, and computes
eigenvalues and eigenmodes of an approximate linear model. Without explicit
knowledge of the
dynamical operator, it extracts frequencies, growth rates, and spatial
structures for each mode.
We show that expansion in DMD modes is unique under certain conditions. When
constructing
mode-based reduced-order models of partial diㄦential equations, subtracting a
mean from the
data set is typically necessary to satisfy boundary conditions. Subtracting
the mean of the data
exactly reduces DMD to the temporal discrete Fourier transform (DFT); this is
restrictive and
generally undesirable. On the other hand, subtracting an equilibrium point
generally preserves
the DMD spectrum and modes. Next, we introduce an \optimized" DMD that
computes an
arbitrary number of dynamical modes from a data set. Compared to DMD,
optimized DMD is
superior at calculating physically relevant frequencies, and is less
numerically sensitive.

the ability to isolate pertinent dynamical information from noisy
measurements. Both algorithms reliably capture dominant fluid dynamic
behaviors, as demonstrated on cylinder wake data collected from both direct
numerical simulations and particle image velocimetry experiments.

Compressed Sensing or Compressive Sensing is about acquiring and recovering a
sparse signal in the most efficient way possible (subsampling) with the help
of an incoherent projecting basis. Unlike traditional sampling methods,
Compressed Sensing provides a new framework for acquiring sparse signals in a
mutiplexed manner. The main theoretical findings in this recent field have
mostly centered on how many multiplexed measurements are necessary to
reconstruct the original signal and the attendant nonlinear reconstruction
techniques needed to demultiplex these signals. Another equally important
thrust in the field has been the actual building of sensing hardware that
could produce directly the multiplexed signals.

We present a unified view of matrix factorization that frames
the differences among popular methods, such as NMF, Weighted SVD,
E-PCA, MMMF, pLSI, pLSI-pHITS, Bregman co-clustering, and many
others, in terms of a small number of modeling choices. Many of these ap-
proaches can be viewed as minimizing a generalized Bregman divergence,
and we show that (i) a straightforward alternating projection algorithm
can be applied to almost any model in our unified view; (ii) the Hessian
for each projection has special structure that makes a Newton projection
feasible, even when there are equality constraints on the factors, which
allows for matrix co-clustering; and (iii) alternating projections can be
generalized to simultaneously factor a set of matrices that share dimen-
sions. These observations immediately yield new optimization algorithms
for the above factorization methods, and suggest novel generalizations of
these methods such as incorporating row and column biases, and adding
or relaxing clustering constraints.

*****
Many problems in computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, pattern/image
recognition, signal processing and machine learning generate massive amounts
of multidimensional data with multiple aspects and high dimensionality.
Tensors (i.e., multi-way arrays) provide often a natural and compact
representation for such massive multidimensional data via suitable low-rank
approximations. Big data analytics require novel technologies to efficiently
process huge datasets within tolerable elapsed times. Such a new emerging
technology for multidimensional big data is a multiway analysis via tensor
networks (TNs) and tensor decompositions (TDs) which represent tensors by sets
of factor (component) matrices and lower-order (core) tensors. Dynamic tensor
analysis allows us to discover meaningful hidden structures of complex data
and to perform generalizations by capturing multi-linear and multi-aspect
relationships. We will discuss some fundamental TN models, their mathematical
and graphical descriptions and associated learning algorithms for large-scale
TDs and TNs, with many potential applications including: Anomaly detection,
feature extraction, classification, cluster analysis, data fusion and
integration, pattern recognition, predictive modeling, regression, time series
analysis and multiway component analysis.

The usual large-scale discretizations are applied to two or three spatial
dimensions. The standard methods fail for higher dimensions because the data
size increases exponentially with the dimension. In the case of a regular grid
with n grid points per direction, a spatial dimension d yields nd grid points.
A grid function defined on such a grid is an example of a tensor of order d.
Here, suitable tensor formats help, since they try to approximate these huge
objects by a much smaller number of parameters, which increases only linearly
in d. In this way, data of size nd = 10001000 can also be treated.
This paper introduces the algebraic and analytical aspects of tensor spaces.
The main part concerns the numerical representation of tensors and the
numerical performance of tensor operations.

Applications* (paper, PDF, 2014, 40) - Boris N. Khoromskij -

*****
We present a brief survey on the modern tensor numerical methods for
multidimensional stationary and time-dependent partial differential equations
(PDEs). The guiding principle of the tensor approach is the rank-structured
separable approximation of multivariate functions and operators represented on
a grid. Recently, the traditional Tucker, canonical, and matrix product states
(tensor train) tensor models have been applied to the grid-based electronic
structure calculations, to parametric PDEs, and to dynamical equations arising
in scientific computing. The essential progress is based on the quantics
tensor approximation method proved to be capable to represent (approximate)
function related d-dimensional data arrays of size Nd with log-volume
complexity, O(dlogN). Combined with the traditional numerical schemes, these
novel tools establish a new promising approach for solving multidimensional
integral and differential equations using low-parametric rank-structured
tensor formats. As the main example, we describe the grid-based tensor
numerical approach for solving the 3D nonlinear Hartree-Fock eigenvalue
problem, that was the starting point for the developments of tensor-structured
numerical methods for large-scale computations in solving real-life
multidimensional problems.

*****
When an algorithm in dimension one is extended to dimension
d, in nearly every case its computational cost is taken to the power
d. This fundamental difficulty is the single greatest impediment to
solving many important problems and has been dubbed the
curse
of dimensionality.
For numerical analysis in dimension
d, we propose to use a representation for vectors and matrices that
generalizes separation of variables while allowing controlled ac-
curacy. Basic linear algebra operations can be performed in this
representation using one-dimensional operations, thus bypassing
the exponential scaling with respect to the dimension. Although
not all operators and algorithms may be compatible with this
representation, we believe that many of the most important ones
are. We prove that the multiparticle
Schrodinger operator, as well
as the inverse Laplacian, can be represented very efficiently in this
form. We give numerical evidence to support the conjecture that
eigenfunctions inherit this property by computing the ground-
state eigenfunction for a simplified
Schrodinger operator with 30
particles. We conjecture and provide numerical evidence that
functions of operators inherit this property, in which case numer-
ical operator calculus in higher dimensions becomes feasible.

*****
We review recent work aimed at modeling species extinction over geological
time. We discuss a number of models which, rather than dealing with the direct
causes of particular extinction events, attempt to predict overall statistical
trends, such as the relative frequencies of large and small extinctions, or
the distribution of the lifetimes of species, genera or higher taxa. We also
describe the available fossil and other data, and compare the trends visible
in these data with the predictions of the models.

*****
The theoretical study of the self-organization of two-dimensional and
geophysical turbulent flows is addressed based on statistical mechanics
methods. This review is a self-contained presentation of classical and recent
works on this subject; from the statistical mechanics basis of the theory up
to applications to Jupiter’s troposphere and ocean vortices and jets.
Emphasize has been placed on examples with available analytical treatment in
order to favor better understanding of the physics and dynamics.

After a brief presentation of the 2D Euler and quasi-geostrophic equations,
the specificity of two-dimensional and geophysical turbulence is emphasized.
The equilibrium microcanonical measure is built from the Liouville theorem.
Important statistical mechanics concepts (large deviations and mean field
approach) and thermodynamic concepts (ensemble inequivalence and negative heat
capacity) are briefly explained and described.

On this theoretical basis, we predict the output of the long time evolution of
complex turbulent flows as statistical equilibria. This is applied to make
quantitative models of two-dimensional turbulence, the Great Red Spot and
other Jovian vortices, ocean jets like the Gulf-Stream, and ocean vortices. A
detailed comparison between these statistical equilibria and real flow
observations is provided.

We also present recent results for non-equilibrium situations, for the studies
of either the relaxation towards equilibrium or non-equilibrium steady states.
In this last case, forces and dissipation are in a statistical balance; fluxes
of conserved quantity characterize the system and microcanonical or other
equilibrium measures no longer describe the system.

Atmospheric Circulation of Terrestrial Exoplanets (paper, PDF, 2013, 56) - 
Adam P. Showman et al. -

*****
The investigation of planets around other stars began with the study of gas
giants, but is now extending to the discovery and characterization of
super-Earths and terrestrial planets. Motivated by this observational tide, we
survey the basic dynamical principles governing the atmospheric circulation of
terrestrial exoplanets, and discuss the interaction of their circulation with
the hydrological cycle and global-scale climate feedbacks. Terrestrial
exoplanets occupy a wide range of physical and dynamical conditions, only a
small fraction of which have yet been explored in detail. Our approach is to
lay out the fundamental dynamical principles governing the atmospheric
circulation on terrestrial planets--broadly defined--and show how they can
provide a foundation for understanding the atmospheric behavior of these
worlds. We first survey basic atmospheric dynamics, including the role of
geostrophy, baroclinic instabilities, and jets in the strongly rotating regime
(the "extratropics") and the role of the Hadley circulation, wave adjustment
of the thermal structure, and the tendency toward equatorial superrotation in
the slowly rotating regime (the "tropics"). We then survey key elements of the
hydrological cycle, including the factors that control precipitation,
humidity, and cloudiness. Next, we summarize key mechanisms by which the
circulation affects the global-mean climate, and hence planetary habitability.
In particular, we discuss the runaway greenhouse, transitions to snowball
states, atmospheric collapse, and the links between atmospheric circulation
and CO2 weathering rates. We finish by summarizing the key questions and
challenges for this emerging field in the future.

The compressional beta effect: a source of zonal winds in planets? -
http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6940[+http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6940+]

*****
Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn feature strong zonal wind patterns on
their surfaces. Although several different mechanisms that may drive these
jets have been proposed over the last decades, the origin of the zonal winds
is still unclear. Here, we explore the possibility that the interplay of
planetary rotation with the compression and expansion of the convecting fluid
can drive multiple deep zonal jets by a compressional Rhines-type mechanism.
In a certain limit, this deep mechanism is shown to be mathematically
analogous to the classical Rhines mechanism possibly operating at cloud level.
Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the anelastic approximation reveal
that this mechanism robustly generates jets of the predicted width, and that
it typically dominates the dynamics in systems deeper than O(lR). Potential
vorticity staircases are observed to form spontaneously and are typically
accompanied by unstably stratified buoyancy staircases. The mechanism only
operates at large rotation rates, exceeding those typically reached in
three-dimensional simulations of deep convection in spherical shells. Applied
to Jupiter and Saturn, the compressional Rhines scaling reasonably fits the
available observations. Interestingly, even weak vertical density variations
such as those in the Earth core can give rise to a large number of jets,
leading to fundamentally different flow structures than predicted by the
Boussinesq models typically used in this context.

Random projections in reducing the dimensionality of climate simulation data

http://www.tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/25274[+http://www.tellusa.net/index.php/tellusa/article/view/25274+]

*****
Random projection (RP) is a dimensionality reduction method that has been
earlier applied to high-dimensional data sets, for instance, in image
processing. This study presents experimental results of RP applied to
simulated global surface temperature data. Principal component analysis (PCA)
is utilised to analyse how RP preserves structures when the original data set
is compressed down to 10% or 1% of its original volume. Our experiments show
that, although information is naturally lost in RP, the main spatial patterns
(the principal component loadings) and temporal signatures (spectra of the
principal component scores) can nevertheless be recovered from the randomly
projected low-dimensional subspaces. Our results imply that RP could be used
as a pre-processing step before analysing the structure of high-dimensional
climate data sets having many state variables, time steps and spatial
locations.

The concept of information in physics: an interdisciplinary topical lecture

*****
I present a didactical project, introducing the concept of information with
all its interdisciplinary ramifications to students of physics and the
neighbouring sciences. Proposed by Boltzmann as entropy, information has
evolved into a common paradigm in science, economy, and culture, superseding
energy in this role. As an integrating factor of the natural sciences at
least, it lends itself as guiding principle for innovative teaching that
transcends the frontiers of the traditional disciplines and emphasizes general
viewpoints. Based on this idea, the postgraduate topical lecture presented
here is intended to provide a firm conceptual basis, technically precise but
versatile enough to be applied to specific topics from a broad range of
fields. Basic notions of physics like causality, chance, irreversibility,
symmetry, disorder, chaos, complexity can be reinterpreted on a common footing
in terms of information and information flow. Dissipation and deterministic
chaos, exemplifying information currents between macroscopic and microscopic
scales, receive special attention. An important part is dedicated to quantum
mechanics as an approach to physics that takes the finiteness of information
systematically into account. Emblematic features like entanglement and
non-locality appear as natural consequences. The course has been planned and
tested for an audience comprising, besides physicists, students of other
natural sciences as well as mathematics, informatics, engineering, sociology,
and philosophy. I sketch history and objectives of this project, provide a
resume of the course, report on experiences gained teaching it in various
formats, and indicate possible future developments.

*****
Selected applications of symmetry methods in the atmospheric sciences are
reviewed briefly. In particular, focus is put on the utilisation of the
classical Lie symmetry approach to derive classes of exact solutions from
atmospheric models. This is illustrated with the barotropic vorticity
equation. Moreover, the possibility for construction of partially-invariant
solutions is discussed for this model. A further point is a discussion of
using symmetries for relating different classes of differential equations.
This is illustrated with the spherical and the potential vorticity equation.
Finally, discrete symmetries are used to derive the minimal finite-mode
version of the vorticity equation first discussed by E. Lorenz (1960) in a
sound mathematical fashion.

Fluctuation-Dissipation: Response Theory in Statistical Physics -
http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0719[+http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0719+]

General aspects of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation (FDR), and Response
Theory are considered. After analyzing the conceptual and historical relevance
of fluctuations in statistical mechanics, we illustrate the relation between
the relaxation of spontaneous fluctuations, and the response to an external
perturbation. These studies date back to Einstein's work on Brownian Motion,
were continued by Nyquist and Onsager and culminated in Kubo's linear response
theory.  The FDR has been originally developed in the framework of statistical
mechanics of Hamiltonian systems, nevertheless a generalized FDR holds under
rather general hypotheses, regardless of the Hamiltonian, or equilibrium
nature of the system. In the last decade, this subject was revived by the
works on Fluctuation Relations (FR) concerning far from equilibrium systems.
The connection of these works with large deviation theory is analyzed.
Some examples, beyond the standard applications of statistical mechanics,
where fluctuations play a major role are discussed: fluids, granular media,
nano-systems and biological systems.
